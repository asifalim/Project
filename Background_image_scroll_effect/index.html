        <h1>welcome to our website</h1>
        <p>There are many variations of passages
        of Lorem Ipsum available, but the 
        majority have suffered alteration
        in some form, by injected humour,</p>
        <p>or randomised words which don't look
        even slightly believable. If you are
        going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
        you need to be sure there isn't anything
        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>
        <p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet
        tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
        making this the first true generator on the Internet.
        It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined</p>
        <p>with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate
        Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem 
        Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
        humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
        <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of 
        denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
        give you a complete account of the system, and expound
        the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,
        the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, 
        dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,</p>
        <p>but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure 
        rationally encounter consequences that are extremely 
        painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or 
        pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because 
        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances</p>
        <p>occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. 
        To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious 
        physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? 
        But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses 
        to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a 
        pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
