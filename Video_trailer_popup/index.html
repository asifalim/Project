        <h1>Movie Title</h1>
        <p>"On the other hand, 
            we denounce with righteous 
            indignation and dislike 
            men who are so beguiled and 
            demoralized by the charms of 
            pleasure of the moment, 
            so blinded by desire, that 
            they cannot foresee the 
            pain and trouble that are 
            bound to ensue; and equal 
            blame belongs to those who 
            fail in their duty through 
            weakness of will, which is 
            the same as saying through 
            shrinking from toil and pain. 
            These cases are perfectly 
            simple and easy to distinguish. 
            In a free hour, when our power 
            of choice is untrammelled and 
            when nothing prevents our 
            being able to do what we 
            like best, every pleasure 
            is to be welcomed and every 
            pain avoided. But in certain 
            circumstances and owing to 
            the claims of duty or the 
            obligations of business it 
            will frequently occur that 
            pleasures have to be repudiated 
            and annoyances accepted. 
            The wise man therefore always 
            holds in these matters to this 
            principle of selection: he 
            rejects pleasures to secure 
            other greater pleasures, or 
            else he endures pains to avoid worse 
            pains."</p>
